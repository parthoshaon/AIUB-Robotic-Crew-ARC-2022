ARC began as a small group of students (mainly third-year undergraduates) with little experience, but they have made up for it with their desire to learn and succeed
in pursuing their goals.

The squad was founded at the beginning of 2015, and by April of that year, they had received consent from their university to begin participating in the competition.
Following that, the AIUB Robotic Crew competed in the University Rover Challenge and represented Bangladesh.
